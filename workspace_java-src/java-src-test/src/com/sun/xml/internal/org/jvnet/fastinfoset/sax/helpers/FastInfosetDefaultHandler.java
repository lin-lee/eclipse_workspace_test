/**
 * Default base class for SAX event handlers of a {@link FastInfosetReader}.
 * <p>
 * This class is available as a convenience for applications: it provides 
 * default implementations for all of the callbacks of the following:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>{@link DefaultHandler}</LI>
 *   <LI>{@link LexicalHandler}</LI>
 *   <LI>{@link EncodingAlgorithmContentHandler}</LI>
 *   <LI>{@link PrimitiveTypeContentHandler}</LI>
 * </UL>
 * Application writers can extend this class when they need to implement only 
 * part of an interface; parser writers can instantiate this class to provide
 * default handlers when the application has not supplied its own.
