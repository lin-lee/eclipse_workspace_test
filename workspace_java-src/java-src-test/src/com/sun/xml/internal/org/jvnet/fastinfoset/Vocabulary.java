/**
 * A canonical representation of a vocabulary.

 * The 1st item contained in a Set is assigned the smallest index value, 
 * n say (where n >= 0). The 2nd item is assigned an index value of n + 1. The kth
 * item is assigned an index value of n + (k - 1).
 * <p>
 * A Fast Infoset parser/serializer implementation will tranform the canonical 
 * representation of a Vocabulary instance into a more optimal form suitable 
 * for the efficient usage according to the API implemented by the parsers and
